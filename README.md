Shortest Path Project
Shortest Path Finder for College Campuses for new students. 

Created a grid with a user selected start and endpoint and barriers and using BFS found the shortest path between two points, showed the path and outputted the distance at the top.

In order to use the visualizer: 


1. You download the respective librariers. 
  a. In your IDE's terminal type in: 
    i).  pip3 install pygame
    ii). pip3 install numpy
    iii). pip3 install pygcurse<img width="586" alt="Screenshot 2023-04-23 at 12 15 25 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65262891/233860231-813c8fc8-b608-401a-a8bf-501c89f90c1d.png">

2. You run the program and let the grid draw in pygame. 
3. You left and right click at the same time to choose your starting point. 
4. You left and right click at the same time to choose your ending point. (These can be the same point but you will just get 0 for the shortest path. 
5. You left and right click and hold and drag to create barriers as you choose. 
6. You press enter and allow for the Shortest path algorithm to find the shortest path and show it to you. 
7. If you want to redo the path (have it show you the same path one more time, you can press anykey.
